		<h2 align="center">Become a Front-End Web Developer</h2>
		<p>
			Get the skills to build engaging, interactive user experiences on the web as a front-end web developer. Learn everything
			you need to design and develop user-facing code, and discover how to bring concepts to life on the browser canvas by combining
			essential graphic design and coding principles.</p>
		<p>Front-end vs Back-end vs Full Stack As a beginner, you might wonder which area of web development to pursue. If you’re
			not 100% sure which one to follow then I recommend you read this blog post on how to become a full stack developer. If
			you’re already sure about front-end development, go ahead and read on.</p>
		<h3>1. Learn HTML & CSS. And become good at it.</h3>
		<p>I guess there’s no way around it. Learn HTML & CSS. Why? Because the basics matter. There are all kinds of different online
			courses available on how to get started with HTML and CSS. First things first. Sign up at Online courses like Coursera
			or Team Treehouse. After finishing some initial courses, go ahead and create some static web pages and iterate over and
			over again. I also recommend developing some small UI elements for practicing your newly learned HTML & CSS skills. Codepen.io
			is a great playground for that. Browse other people’s projects and participate in the community there.</p>
		<h3>2. Build things && and focus on things</h3>
		<p>Playing around with (small) UI elements is one thing. Creating an actual landing page or website is something different.
			At some point, you will eventually start using JavaScript snippets. Don’t forget to challenge yourself by building first
			responsive elements. So there’s only one way to becoming better at what you’re doing: Keep learning, keep building. Putting
			these two together, build to learn! There’s no better way to learn than to get your hands dirty. You’ve probably heard
			this a hundred times by now, but it is for a good reason why this is the advice most often dished out.</p>
		<h3>3. There’s more to front-end development than building a website</h3>
		<p>If you followed my tips from 1 to 3, you have probably already done a course or have read a lot of tutorials and are now
			able to throw together a website. However, that doesn’t equate to being a “front-end developer”. Knowing how to build
			a website is a very small part of the front-end puzzle. I apologise if that sounds demotivating. But that’s actually the
			case. There is a whole load of topics that you still should learn about. If we consider performance, testing, QA and many
			other areas, then you really need to become a deep diver as a front-end developer.</p>
		<h3>4. Dive deep into frameworks</h3>
		<p>So, you made it until here. Awesome!
			<br> Now it’s time to get involved with certain frameworks. Start by looking at the more popular ones and work out for yourself
			why they do things in a certain way. Figure out whether each one is a good thing. Understand how frameworks and industry
			standards have changed over the last couple of years. Looking at older frameworks, you will probably discover approaches
			and code which are now obsolete. Do not forget: Sometimes, using a framework isn’t the best option, but most of the time
			it’s well worth knowing about them.</p>
		<h3>
			5. Get involved with open source projects
		</h3>
		<p>Contribute to FOSS on GitHub. Don’t shy away from big frameworks that seem well established. Even framework authors make
			mistakes. You may be spending most of your time reading code but don’t see it as a waste of time. You will pick up good
			habits and practices along the way and will gain some experience working with other developers. When you feel ready to
			write some code, go through issues on the repository and pick one problem which is manageable for you. Getting involved
			with various projects, especially open source, will not only make you a better front-end developer, but it will also help
			you build up your very own online brand as an active, experienced developer.</p>
